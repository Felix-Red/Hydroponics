# Hydroponics Project Collaboration

This repository contains files related to a hydroponics project, a collaborative effort between Belgium Campus University and Penn State University. Hydroponics, a subset of hydroculture, is an innovative method of growing plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.

The project, part of **ENGR 422** (Penn State) and **PRJ 381** (Belgium Campus), aims to design, fabricate, and test a functional prototype of a classroom demonstration kit. This kit is designed to educate middle school students on:
1. The importance of proper nutrition,
2. The fundamentals of hydroponics,
3. The engineering principles underlying hydroponic systems.

The prototype will include a physical "farm," an IT framework, and supporting materials suitable for a class of approximately 30 students. The project's overarching goal is to promote community transformation through education-based engineering, emphasizing that the solution must not only work but also be culturally relevant, accepted, and sustainable.

### Project Subsystems
The project is divided into three key subsystems, each managed by students from both institutions:
1. **Hydro (Water and Structures)** – Covers water flow, physical structures, nutrient monitoring, and chemical injection.
2. **Electro (Electrical and Controls)** – Focuses on power management (wall/solar), data handling, processing, and network connectivity (WiFi).
3. **Photon (Lighting and Plant Growth/Health)** – Involves the design and optimization of lighting, plant monitoring, and nutrient management.

### My Contribution
I collaborated with international students from Penn State University, contributing to the integration of technologies like **Node-RED** and **Arduino Uno** for sensor implementation. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of cultural dynamics, leadership, and teamwork, reinforcing the value of effective collaboration in achieving successful project outcomes.
